CURRENT FOLDER
==============

This folder is used by the "All Language Process" in VRS Manager.

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Place your CURRENT version language files here:
   - File with "_KR" in name (Korean) - REQUIRED
   - File with "_EN" in name (English) - REQUIRED
   - File with "_CN" in name (Chinese) - REQUIRED

2. All three language files are REQUIRED in the Current folder.
   The Previous folder files are optional.

EXAMPLE FILE NAMES:
-------------------
- VoiceData_Current_KR.xlsx
- VoiceData_Current_EN.xlsx
- VoiceData_Current_CN.xlsx

NOTE:
-----
The All Language Process will automatically detect files based on the
"_KR", "_EN", "_CN" suffix in the filename. Make sure your files follow
this naming convention.

For other processes (Raw, Working, Master), you can select files manually -
this folder is NOT required.
