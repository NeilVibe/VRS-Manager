PREVIOUS FOLDER
===============

This folder is used by the "All Language Process" in VRS Manager.

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Place your PREVIOUS version language files here:
   - File with "_KR" in name (Korean)
   - File with "_EN" in name (English)
   - File with "_CN" in name (Chinese)

2. All three languages are optional - include only the ones you want to update.

EXAMPLE FILE NAMES:
-------------------
- VoiceData_Previous_KR.xlsx
- VoiceData_Previous_EN.xlsx
- VoiceData_Previous_CN.xlsx

NOTE:
-----
The All Language Process will automatically detect files based on the
"_KR", "_EN", "_CN" suffix in the filename. Make sure your files follow
this naming convention.

For other processes (Raw, Working, Master), you can select files manually -
this folder is NOT required.
