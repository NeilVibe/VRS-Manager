Build Trigger File
==================

This file is used to trigger GitHub Actions builds.
When this file is updated and pushed to main, a build will automatically start.

Last build: v1.120.0 (Failed - model not in repo)
Current build: v1.120.0 (FIXED - model now in git via LFS!)

Build v1.120.0 - Phase 3.0 Professional Installer System (FINAL FIX)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:
✅ BERT model now stored in git repo using Git LFS
✅ Model included when repo is cloned
✅ No more download failures
✅ PyInstaller will find model immediately

Git LFS Setup:
- models/kr-sbert/model.safetensors (467MB) tracked via LFS
- Model available in every build automatically
- No internet dependency for model download

This build creates TWO installers:

1. LIGHT Version (~150MB)
   - Core VRS Check features
   - No BERT model needed

2. FULL Version (~2.6GB)
   - Everything in LIGHT
   - BERT model bundled from repo (via LFS)
   - 100% offline operation

PROBLEM SOLVED: "Unable to find models/kr-sbert" error fixed!
