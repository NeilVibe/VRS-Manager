Build v1.120.0 - Phase 3.0 (CRITICAL FIXES - Build #2)
------------------------------------------------------

FIXES APPLIED IN THIS BUILD:
✅ Git LFS enabled in all checkout steps
✅ Inno Setup OutputDir corrected (..\installer_output)
✅ Model tracked in LFS (467MB)
✅ PyInstaller COLLECT creates folder structure
✅ Workflow verification uses correct paths
✅ No download step (model from LFS)

Previous Build Failures (13:32:38Z):
- FULL: Failed at "Verify BERT model (from LFS)" - LFS not enabled
- LIGHT: Failed at "Compile LIGHT installer" - Wrong OutputDir

Build creates TWO Windows installers:

LIGHT Version (~150MB):
- Path: dist_light/VRSManager/VRSManager.exe
- No BERT model
- Output: installer_output/VRSManager_v1.120.0_Light_Setup.exe

FULL Version (~2.6GB):
- Path: dist_full/VRSManager/VRSManager.exe
- BERT model bundled from LFS
- Output: installer_output/VRSManager_v1.120.0_Full_Setup.exe

All critical errors fixed - testing build #2!
