Build v1.120.0 - Phase 3.0 Professional Installer System (RETRY)
------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:
✅ Upgraded artifact actions v3 → v4 (fixes deprecation error)
✅ Model loads from bundled path FIRST (100% offline, no AppData)

This build creates TWO installers:

1. LIGHT Version (~150MB)
   - Core VRS Check features
   - Punctuation/Space detection
   - Fast, lightweight
   - StrOrigin shows: "Punctuation/Space Change" or "Content Change"

2. FULL Version (~2.6GB)
   - Everything in LIGHT
   - PyTorch + Korean BERT model (bundled)
   - AI-powered semantic similarity
   - StrOrigin shows: "Punctuation/Space Change" or "XX.X% similar"
   - 100% offline - loads model from bundle, NOT AppData!

Both versions:
- 100% offline operation
- Professional Windows installers
- Start Menu integration
- Fully portable
- Everything in ONE program folder (no AppData/temp downloads)

Changes from previous attempt:
- Fixed deprecated upload-artifact@v3 → v4
- Fixed model loading order (bundled first, online fallback)
- Model won't download to AppData anymore
