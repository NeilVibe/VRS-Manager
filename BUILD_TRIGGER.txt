Build v1.120.0 - Phase 3.0 Professional Installer System
---------------------------------------------------------

ALL FIXES APPLIED:
✅ BERT model in git via LFS (no download failures)
✅ PyInstaller creates folder structure (not monolith)
✅ Inno Setup scripts match new folder structure
✅ Artifact actions upgraded to v4
✅ Model loads from bundled path first (offline priority)

This build creates TWO professional Windows installers:

1. LIGHT Version Installer (~150MB)
   Installs to: C:\Program Files\VRS Manager\
   - VRSManager.exe
   - _internal\ (core dependencies)
   - No BERT model
   - Shows "Content Change" for StrOrigin

2. FULL Version Installer (~2.6GB)
   Installs to: C:\Program Files\VRS Manager\
   - VRSManager.exe
   - _internal\ (all dependencies + BERT model)
   - Shows "XX.X% similar" for StrOrigin
   - 100% offline operation

Build Process:
1. Clone repo → Model included (via LFS) ✅
2. PyInstaller → Creates folder structure ✅
3. Inno Setup → Finds files correctly ✅
4. Upload installers ✅
5. Create GitHub Release ✅

Ready to build!
