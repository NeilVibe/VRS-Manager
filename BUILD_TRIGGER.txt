Build Trigger File - MODULAR BUILD SYSTEM
==========================================

USAGE:
------
Add a line with the build command, then commit & push to main.

FORMATS:
  Build LIGHT v[version]  → Build LIGHT installer only (~150MB)
  Build FULL v[version]   → Build FULL installer only (~2.6GB)
  Build BOTH v[version]   → Build BOTH installers (default)

EXAMPLES:
  Build LIGHT v11201430   → Only builds LIGHT version
  Build FULL v11201430    → Only builds FULL version

WORKFLOW:
1. Update version across all 12 files (use check_version_unified.py)
2. Add build command to this file
3. Commit and push to main
4. GitHub Actions will automatically build specified version(s)

The latest "Build" line will be used to determine what to build.
