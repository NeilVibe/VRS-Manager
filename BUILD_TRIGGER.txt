Build v1.120.0 - Phase 3.0 (ALL CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED)
--------------------------------------------------------

FINAL FIXES:
✅ Model in git via LFS (no download needed)
✅ PyInstaller COLLECT creates folder structure
✅ Inno Setup matches folder structure
✅ Workflow verification uses correct paths
✅ No download step (model from LFS)
✅ Old executable workflow removed

Build creates TWO Windows installers:

LIGHT Version (~150MB):
- Path: dist_light/VRSManager/VRSManager.exe
- No BERT model

FULL Version (~2.6GB):
- Path: dist_full/VRSManager/VRSManager.exe
- BERT model bundled from LFS

All errors fixed - ready to build!
